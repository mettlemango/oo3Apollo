Rules of the Game:
Welcome to the Mikey's Beach Adventure! The objective is to make choices that have positive effects on sealife. Remember, to win, you must select all the choices that benefit sealife and avoid the bad choices. If a bad choice is made, the game ends, and you will be given the option to try again. Let's explore the game's structure, which consists of three scenarios.

Meet Mikey, our protagonist, who faces the choice between plastic and paper straws.

  BAD CHOICE: If Mikey chooses the plastic straw, the game is over. It will display factual information about how plastic straws harm sealife.
  GOOD CHOICE: If Mikey chooses the paper straw, the story continues to the next scenario. It will show facts on how paper straws benefit sealife.

Scenario 2:
After finishing his milk tea, Mikey now has the option to throw his plastic cup and straw in the trash.

  BAD CHOICE: If Mikey chooses to throw his plastic cup on the beach, the game ends. It will demonstrate the negative impact of beach trash on sealife.
  GOOD CHOICE: If Mikey chooses to dispose of his plastic cup and straws in the trash, the game continues to the next scenario. It will present facts about how proper trash segregation benefits sealife.

Scenario 3:
Mikey notices someone in a similar situation as he was before and must decide whether to intervene.

  BAD CHOICE: If Mikey decides to ignore the situation, the game ends. It will deliver a speech encouraging players to do better and showcase the consequences of not taking action through engaging visuals.
  GOOD CHOICE: If Mikey decides not to ignore the situation, you win the game!
