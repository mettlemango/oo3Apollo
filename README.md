Description:
Mikey's Beach Adventure is a visual novel game that focuses on a boy named Mikey and his little adventure on the beach. This game has three major points in the story where the player decides what Mikey does that will affect the story and which ending they get. The game will only have two endings, one good ending and one bad ending. The main message it should send to the players is that they should be more aware of their choices that could potentially affect the sea life.
